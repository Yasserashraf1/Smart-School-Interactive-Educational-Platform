## 🌟 Overview

**Smart School** is a comprehensive, offline-capable Flutter application engineered to modernize the study experience for Egyptian secondary school students. The platform transforms conventional learning into an engaging, gamified journey — giving students access to rich multimedia content, interactive quizzes, and personalized progress tracking, all from their mobile device.

> Built from the ground up by a sole Flutter developer, the app demonstrates a production-ready architecture with clean, scalable code and a student-centric UI/UX philosophy.

## Key Features

### Structured Learning Modules
Subjects and lessons are organized within an intuitive navigation system (Home → Subjects → Lessons), making it easy for students to find and follow their curriculum.

### Rich Media Integration
Embedded YouTube player and external resource linking deliver diverse study materials — video lectures, articles, and more — directly inside the app without switching contexts.

### Interactive Assessments
A dynamic quiz engine presents questions, captures student responses, and delivers immediate, actionable feedback to reinforce learning at the right moment.

### Gamification & Engagement
- **Lottie Animations** — fluid, expressive micro-interactions
- **Confetti Celebrations** — reward students on achievements
- **Percent Indicators** — visual progress bars that motivate continued effort

### Offline-First Capabilities
Local SQLite storage ensures students can access their progress, lessons, and saved data anytime — even without an internet connection.

### Personalized User Profiles
An engaging onboarding flow with customizable user profiles and an interactive **avatar selection** system gives each student a sense of ownership over their learning experience.

### Progress Tracking & Analytics
A comprehensive dashboard lets students monitor subject progress, track quiz performance over time, and identify areas that need more attention.

### Localization (L10n)
Fully configured with Flutter's internationalization support, enabling seamless multi-language flexibility for future expansion.
