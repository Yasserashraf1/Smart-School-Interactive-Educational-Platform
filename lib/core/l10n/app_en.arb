  "lesson1Step1Title": "Water on Our Planet",
  "lesson1Step1Content": "Earth is often called the 'Blue Planet' because about 71% of its surface is covered with water. The total volume of water on Earth is approximately 1.4 billion cubic kilometers.\n\nThis vast body of water is called the Hydrosphere.\n\nWater is distributed as follows:\n• Saltwater (oceans & seas): 97.5%\n• Freshwater: only 2.5%\n\nOf the 2.5% freshwater:\n• Glaciers & ice caps: 68.7%\n• Groundwater: 30.1%\n• Surface water (rivers, lakes): 1.2%",
  "lesson1Step2Title": "Types of Water Bodies",
  "lesson1Step2Content": "Water exists in many forms on our planet:\n\n🌊 Oceans & Seas — The largest water bodies, containing saltwater. The five oceans are the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern, and Arctic.\n\n🏞️ Rivers — Flowing freshwater bodies that carry water from mountains to seas.\n\n🏔️ Glaciers — Massive ice bodies formed from compressed snow over thousands of years.\n\n💧 Groundwater — Water stored beneath the Earth's surface in rock formations called aquifers.\n\n☁️ Atmospheric Water — Water vapor in the air, forming clouds and precipitation.",
  "lesson1Step3Title": "The Water Cycle",
  "lesson1Step3Content": "The Water Cycle is the continuous movement of water through the Earth system. It is driven by two forces: the Sun's energy and gravity.\n\nThe stages are:\n\n1️⃣ Evaporation — The Sun heats water in oceans, lakes, and rivers, turning it into water vapor that rises into the atmosphere.\n\n2️⃣ Transpiration — Plants release water vapor through their leaves, adding to atmospheric moisture.\n\n3️⃣ Condensation — As water vapor rises and cools, it condenses into tiny droplets, forming clouds.\n\n4️⃣ Precipitation — When droplets combine and become heavy enough, they fall as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.\n\n5️⃣ Collection — Water flows back into oceans, rivers, and lakes, or seeps into the ground to become groundwater.\n\nThis cycle has been running for billions of years and is essential for life on Earth.",
  "lesson1CheckQ": "What percentage of Earth's water is freshwater?",
  "lesson1CheckA1": "97.5%",
  "lesson1CheckA2": "2.5%",
  "lesson1CheckA3": "50%",
  "lesson1CheckA4": "25%",
  "lesson1CheckCorrect": "1",
  "lesson1CheckExplanation": "Only 2.5% of Earth's total water is freshwater. The remaining 97.5% is saltwater in oceans and seas.",
  "lesson2Step1Title": "The Water Molecule",
  "lesson2Step1Content": "Water (H₂O) is one of the most remarkable molecules in nature. Each water molecule consists of:\n• 2 Hydrogen atoms (H)\n• 1 Oxygen atom (O)\n\nThe oxygen atom is more electronegative than hydrogen, meaning it attracts the shared electrons more strongly. This creates an uneven distribution of electrical charge.\n\nAs a result, the water molecule is polar:\n• The oxygen side carries a slight negative charge (δ−)\n• The hydrogen side carries a slight positive charge (δ+)\n\nThis polarity is the key to almost all of water's special properties.",
  "lesson2Step2Title": "Hydrogen Bonding",
  "lesson2Step2Content": "Because water molecules are polar, the positive hydrogen end of one molecule is attracted to the negative oxygen end of another. This attraction is called a Hydrogen Bond.\n\nHydrogen bonds give water unique properties:\n\n🔬 High Boiling Point — Water stays liquid at temperatures where similar molecules would be gas.\n\n🧊 Ice Floats — Water expands when frozen, making ice less dense than liquid water. This protects aquatic life in winter.\n\n💪 Surface Tension — Water molecules at the surface hold together tightly, allowing small insects to walk on water.\n\n🌡️ High Specific Heat — Water can absorb a lot of heat before its temperature rises, stabilizing Earth's climate.",
  "lesson2Step3Title": "Water as a Solvent",
  "lesson2Step3Content": "Water is called the 'Universal Solvent' because it can dissolve more substances than any other liquid.\n\nHow it works:\nWhen a substance like table salt (NaCl) enters water, the polar water molecules surround the ions:\n• The negative oxygen side attracts Na⁺ ions\n• The positive hydrogen side attracts Cl⁻ ions\n\nThis pulls the crystal apart and dissolves it.\n\nAqueous Solutions in Nature:\n• Seawater contains dissolved salts (average 35 g/L)\n• Blood is an aqueous solution carrying nutrients\n• Plant sap transports dissolved minerals from roots to leaves\n\npH & Water Quality:\npH measures how acidic or basic water is:\n• pH 7 = neutral (pure water)\n• pH < 7 = acidic\n• pH > 7 = basic\nAquatic organisms require specific pH ranges to survive.",
  "lesson2CheckQ": "Why is water called a 'polar molecule'?",
  "lesson2CheckA1": "Because it exists at the North and South Poles",
  "lesson2CheckA2": "Because the charge is unevenly distributed in the molecule",
  "lesson2CheckA3": "Because it can dissolve any substance",
  "lesson2CheckA4": "Because it has a high boiling point",
  "lesson2CheckCorrect": "1",
  "lesson2CheckExplanation": "Water is polar because oxygen attracts electrons more strongly than hydrogen, creating an uneven charge distribution — negative near oxygen, positive near hydrogen.",
  "lesson3Step1Title": "Water and Life",
  "lesson3Step1Content": "Water is the foundation of all known life. Consider these facts:\n\n💧 The human body is about 60-70% water\n💧 A jellyfish is about 95% water\n💧 Even a tree is about 60% water\n\nWater plays critical roles in living organisms:\n\n🔄 Transport — Blood (which is mostly water) carries oxygen and nutrients to cells, and removes waste products.\n\n⚗️ Chemical Reactions — Most biochemical reactions happen in water. It's the medium where enzymes work.\n\n🌡️ Temperature Regulation — Sweating cools the body through evaporation. Water's high specific heat prevents rapid temperature changes.\n\n🏗️ Structure — Water gives cells their shape and volume through turgor pressure in plants.",
  "lesson3Step2Title": "Aquatic Adaptations",
  "lesson3Step2Content": "Living organisms have evolved remarkable adaptations to survive in water:\n\n🐟 Fish:\n• Gills extract dissolved oxygen from water\n• Streamlined bodies reduce water resistance\n• Swim bladders control buoyancy\n\n🐋 Marine Mammals:\n• Thick blubber for insulation in cold water\n• Can hold breath for extended periods\n• Echolocation for navigation\n\n🌿 Aquatic Plants:\n• Air spaces in tissues for buoyancy\n• Flexible stems that bend with currents\n• Stomata on upper leaf surfaces (in floating plants)\n\n🦠 Microscopic Organisms:\n• Phytoplankton — tiny plants that produce 50-70% of Earth's oxygen\n• Zooplankton — tiny animals that form the base of aquatic food chains",
  "lesson3Step3Title": "Ecological Balance & Human Impact",
  "lesson3Step3Content": "Aquatic ecosystems maintain a delicate balance. Here's how it works:\n\n⚖️ The Balance:\n• Producers (algae, water plants) make food using sunlight\n• Consumers (fish, animals) eat producers or other consumers\n• Decomposers break down dead organisms, recycling nutrients\n\n⚠️ Human Threats to This Balance:\n\n🏭 Industrial Pollution — Factories dumping chemicals into rivers and seas\n🧴 Plastic Pollution — 8 million tons of plastic enter oceans yearly\n🌡️ Global Warming — Rising temperatures harm coral reefs and change habitats\n🚰 Over-extraction — Taking too much groundwater faster than it's replenished\n\n🛡️ How We Can Help:\n• Reduce plastic use and recycle\n• Support wastewater treatment\n• Protect wetlands and coral reefs\n• Use water responsibly\n\nThe sustainability of aquatic ecosystems depends on responsible human action.",
